# MoodFlow.io

## Description
MoodFlow.io (commonly just MoodFlow) is an open-source library for random tensor processes.
While some libraries like TensorFlow and numpy are meant strictly for common algorithms
and data structures associated with ML, MoodFlow.io is focused on helping developers build
gradual stochastic processes at scale, so that tensor fields are not bound by algorithms or
ML models alone. At scale and at complexity, it is expected that this will help create more
organic simulations in AI.
